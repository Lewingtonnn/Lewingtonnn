## 🏎️ TL;DR (if you only skim one section)
- Founder of **Intellicore Data Lab** — a premium R&D lab for **data engineering & AI pipelines**.  
- Architect behind the **Crypto Intelligence Pipeline** — a production-grade system fusing **market, on-chain, and sentiment data**.  
- Building at the edge of **real-time data, MLOps, and intelligent automation**.  
- Not “learning to code.” Not “building toy apps.” → **Designing scalable, enterprise systems**.

## 🪂 About Me
I’m Lewis — a data engineer and systems builder obsessed with making data *work harder*.  
Through **Intellicore Data Lab**, I craft pipelines and platforms that don’t just *run* — they **scale, self-heal, and deliver insight**.  

- I think in **flows** not just functions.  
- I see pipelines as **products**, not scripts.  
- I care about **premium engineering**: clean, observable, resilient.  

💡 My philosophy: *Data is only as valuable as the intelligence it creates.*

## 🔭 Current Focus
- **Intellicore Data Lab** → my home for experiments & enterprise-grade builds.  
- **Insights Hub** → essays on the craft of data engineering & intelligent systems.  
- **Next frontier**: real-time ML pipelines + automation architectures.
