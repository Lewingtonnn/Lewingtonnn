## 🪂 About Me
I’m Lewis — a data engineer and systems builder obsessed with making data *work harder*.  
Through **Intellicore Data Lab**, I craft pipelines and platforms that don’t just *run* — they **scale, self-heal, and deliver insight**.  

- I think in **flows** not just functions.  
- I see pipelines as **products**, not scripts.  
- I care about **premium engineering**: clean, observable, resilient.  

💡 My philosophy: *Data is only as valuable as the intelligence it creates.*

## 🔭 Current Focus
- **Intellicore Data Lab** → my home for experiments & enterprise-grade builds.  
- **Insights Hub** → essays on the craft of data engineering & intelligent systems.  
- **Next frontier**: real-time ML pipelines + automation architectures.
